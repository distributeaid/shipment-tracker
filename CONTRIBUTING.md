Thanks so much for your interest in contributing to Distribute Aid! We really
appreciate your help. The foundation of the refugee aid movement is built by
everyday folks putting in a few hours every week, and you should be proud to be
a part of it.

Through your work with Distribute Aid you will make it easier for hundreds of
aid workers on the ground to improve the lives of tens of thousands of
newcomers.

We take a people-first approach at Distribute Aid, and will do our best to match
you up with work that fits your skill set and interests. Please introduce
yourself in [our Slack](https://distributeaid.github.io/slack-invite-link/) and
which technologies you are familiar with as well as how much time you are
willing to commit for your contributions.

We'll match you with one of our tech leads to get you started on your first
contribution. We maintain an overview of all our projects and where to find good
beginner issues
[on Notion](https://www.notion.so/distributeaid/CONTRIBUTING-4ba5060441e44925b5e22aa674d4729e).

Again, thanks so much for helping us on this project. We're on track to save
refugee aid groups hundreds of hours and create hundreds of thousands of Euros
in value for the refugee aid supply chain every year!

We look forward to working with you!
