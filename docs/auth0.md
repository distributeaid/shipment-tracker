# Auth0 configuration

We use Auth0 for authentication and authorization.

Our Auth0 configuration is stored in GitHub, in the [https://github.com/distributeaid/auth0](distributeaid/auth0) repository. Whenever a change is merge in that repo, the Auth0 configuration is automatically updated.

See https://github.com/distributeaid/auth0/blob/saga/clients/shipment-tracker.json.
